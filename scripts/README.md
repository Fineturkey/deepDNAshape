# Scripts of training the model and utilities

## Convert DNA shape features to DNA structures (.pdb)

Firstly, predict 12 DNA shape features for one sequence and put them into one single sub-directory

Secondly, use `preditions2par.py` to convert the predictions to PAR file.

Thirdly, use `rebuild` program in `X3DNA` package to rebuild DNA structure from the PAR file. 

## Train a model from scratch
